# Hi there ðŸ–¤ I am Phuong Tran (Annette)

Fueled by curiosity and an intense desire to build impactful products, I am diving deep into the intersection of entrepreneurship and tech product innovation, where dynamic roles in Product, Data Analytics, and a foundation in UX/UI allow me to contribute meaningfully to any-stage ventures. With experience contributing to tech startup projects as a founding product member, Iâ€™ve worked on user flows, interface design, and usability optimisation while also growing my toolkit in SQL, Power BI, and product frameworks.

## ðŸ§­ Let's build something amazing together!

## ðŸŽ¡ My toolkit
- **Data Analytics**: SQL, Power BI, Tableau, SAP, Looker Studio, Excel
- **Product Discovery & UX/UI Design**: Skilled in user research, prototyping with Figma, and iterative MVP development. I have been executing product strategy for early-stage ventures.

I'm eager to bring my analytical rigor, creative problem-solving, and entrepreneurial spirit to startups, data teams, or product roles. Whether it's querying complex datasets, prototyping user-centric apps, or strategizing for market growth, I'm ready to make an impact!
